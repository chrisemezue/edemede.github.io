# Edemede
In the move to include African languages in natural language processing (NLP), it has become imperative to have a convenient means of typing in these African langugaes, which may contain unique accents, diacritics and completely new alphabets.

The presence of a specialized keyboard for the Igbo language, will foster typing in the language, thereby increasing the amount of online presence of the language.

Edemede is the the first complete online Igbo Keyboard.
Edemede is free, open-source online keyboard with the special Igbo diacritics.
Although in its early stage, Edemede contains the full functionalities to make one type easily. There will be updates to improve the platform on a regular basis.
