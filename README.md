# Motivation  
In the move to include African languages in natural language processing (NLP), it has become imperative to have a convenient means of typing in these African langugaes, which may contain unique accents, diacritics and completely new alphabets.

The presence of a specialized keyboard for the Igbo language, will foster typing in the language, thereby increasing the amount of online presence of the language.
# Pilot stage: Ed&#233;m&#233;d&#233; for Igbo;
Ed&#233;m&#233;d&#233; is free, open-source online keyboard with the special Igbo diacritics.
Although in its early stage, Ed&#233;m&#233;d&#233; contains the full functionalities to make one type easily. There will be updates to improve the platform on a regular basis.

# Features
We are always working to include features to make typing very easy and enjoyable. At the moment, we have:
* Sleek design
* Integration with PC Keyboard: while typing with your PC keyboard, you can press:
    * Shift + a to toggle between &#7841;, &#224;, &#225;
    * Shift + e to toggle between &#7865;, &#232; , &#233;
    * Shift + i to toggle between &#7883;, &#236;, &#237;
    * Shift + o to toggle between &#7885;, &#242;, &#243;
    * Shift + u to toggle between &#7909;, &#249;, &#250;
* Auto complete suggestion

# Next phase
The long-term goal of this project is to create a central platform for ***typing in as many African languages as possible***.
* Implementation with mobile devices (Android and OS).
* Creating and collating dictionaries for the African languages.
* TBD.
